# Getting Started

Hello World - string (make sure to encapsulate a string with '' or "" or '''''' or """"""
1234556 - integer (negative or nonegative whole number)
123.456 - float (has a decimal)

python has order of operations
* - multiplication
/ - division (returns float)
// - integer division or div (returns integer)
% - mod (remainder, kind of like a complement to div)

syntax errors - prevents python from running the file entirely (compile time error)
runtime error - stops after reaching the line (crash)
logical error - compiles and runs, but is wrong
